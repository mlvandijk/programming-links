**Reactive programming** is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. 
This means that it becomes possible to express static (e.g. arrays) or dynamic (e.g. event emitters) data streams with ease via the employed programming language(s).

**RxJava** implemented reactive programming on the JVM


## Patterns

The **observer pattern** is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, 
and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

In object-oriented programming, the **iterator pattern** is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. 
The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.

# Terminology

## Programming languages

**Statically typed programming language** - the type of every expression in a program is known at compile time, 
and the compiler can validate that the methods and fields you're trying to access exist on the objects you're using.

**Dynamically typed programming language** - let you define variables and functions that can store or return data of any type 
and resolve the method and field reference at runtime.
